## NorteX's Discord Bot Creator
...is a piece of software to allow you to easily create bots for your Discord server.

NDBC employs a system of blueprints with nodes to create a sequential program that runs your discord bot.

In some ways, this system could be considered programming, just simplified.

The app is built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) which means it's ran by Rust & TypeScript (Next.JS -> React).

### Running
To run this software, install it via an installer for your operating system. They are available in [releases](https://github.com/NorteX-dev/nortexbotmaker/releases).

### Building
You can use `yarn run build` to build a fresh version of the app.

### Contributing
You can fork or clone the repo. To run the app in development mode (HMR + rust on-change recompile), use `yarn run tauri dev`.
